# Welcome to OpenDUck

OpenDUck is an open-source implementation of dynamic undocking (DUck), an application of steered molecular dynamics developed as a fast algorithm to calculate the work necessary to reach a quasi-bound state, at which a certain native contact is broken between the ligand and receptor. Due to its cheap and fast nature, DUck is mainly employed as a post-docking filter during virtual screening campaigns.

More details can be found in the original dynamic undocking publication:

> Ruiz-Carmona, S., Schmidtke, P., Luque, F. et al. Dynamic undocking and the quasi-bound state as tools for drug discovery. Nature Chem 9, 201â€“206 (2017). https://doi.org/10.1038/nchem.2660

## Installation

### Conda (update)

We recommend you install OpenDUck into a fresh Conda environment.
```{bash}
$ git clone https://github.com/roncv/openduck.git
$ cd openduck
$ conda env create -f environment.yaml
$ conda activate openduck
$ python setup.py install
```

## OpenDUck usage

OpenDUck can be used either as a Python library or as an executable. The executable provided is `openduck`, which is automatically added to your path if you install with pip or conda. Alternatively you can use openduck.py in the scripts subdirectory.

OpenDUck comes with several submodules to launch the different steps of dynamic undocking:

```{bash}
$ conda activate openduck

$ openduck -h

usage: openduck [-h]  ...

Open-source toolkit for dynamic undocking.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Open-source dynamic undocking toolkit. Choose one of the following actions::

    openmm-prepare      Preparation of systems for OpenMM simulations.
    openmm-full-protocol
                        OpenDUck full OpenMM protocol.
    openmm-from-equilibrated
                        OpenDUck OpenMM protocol starting from a pre-equilibrated system.
    openmm-from-amber   OpenDUck OpenMM protocol starting from an AMBER topology and coordinates.
    amber-prepare       Preparation of systems, inputs and queue files for AMBER simulations.
    report              Generate a report for OpenDUck results.
    chunk               Chunk a protein for dynamic undocking.
```

Each of the OpenDUck modules accepts the input either as command line arguments or as a yaml file.
The arguments in the input.yaml are expected to follow the command-line nomenclature.

### Running OpenDUck with OpenMM

The OpenMM implementation of OpenDUck is divided in two steps: the preparation using `openmm_forcefields` and the production (MD/SMD) following the dynamic undocking protocol.
During the preparation step, the protein is reduced to the pocket region during the _chunking_ step, then the ligand and receptor are parametrized and the solvation box is generated. After equilibration, the sequential MD/SMD simulations, sampling and steering the main interaction from the specified distances, are run in OpenMM.

The openMM submodules are set up to allow independent usage of the previously mentioned steps:

    * `openmm-full-protocol`: Executes the full OpenDuck protocol, from the protein-ligand files to the steered simulations
    * `openmm-prepare`: Executes only the preparation and equilibration of the protein-ligand complex
    * `openmm-from-equilibrated`: Executes only the production of MD/SMD runs from an equilibrated input.
    * `openmm-from-amber`: Starts the openDuck simulations from an AMBER topology.

#### openmm-full-protocol

The complete OpenDUck protocol through OpenMM can be executed using the `openmm-full-protocol` submodule.
The full protocol executes the following steps:

    * Chunking (optional)
    * Preparation
      * Ligand parametrization
      * Receptor parametrization
      * Box generation
    * Equilibration
    * (MD + SMD@300K + SMD@325K + WQB check ) x smd-cycles

```{bash}
openduck openmm-full-protocol -y input.yaml
```
where the `input.yaml` file has the following
```{yaml}
# Main Arguments

```

#### openmm-prepare & openmm-from-equilibrated

The OpenDUck protocol can also be executed independently in two steps: the preparation & equilibration with the `openmm-prepare` subcommand and the production with the `openmm-from-equilibrated` subcommand. Following the schema presented above, each substep is performed by running the following subcommands.

    openmm-prepare
      * Chunking (optional)
      * Preparation
        * Ligand parametrization
        * Receptor parametrization
        * Box generation
      * Equilibration
    openmm-from-equilibrated
      * (MD + SMD@300K + SMD@325K + WQB check ) x smd-cycles

Each of the two subcommads share arguments with the openmm-full-protocol, based on the execution steps they have in common. As with the previus command, the execution can come from flagged arguments or with the same arguments in a yaml input file.

Sample yaml input files for `openmm-prepare` and `openmm-from-equilibrated` are provided below:

```
# openmm-prepare input.yaml
# Main arguments
ligand_mol : '1a28_lig.mol'
receptor_pdb : '1a28_prot.pdb'
interaction : 'A_ARG_766_NH2'

```

```
 # openmm-from-equilibrated

pickle : complex_system.pickle
smd_cycles : 20
md_length : 0.5
wqb_threshold : 6
gpu_id : 0
```

#### openmm-from-amber

Alternatively, the OpenDUck protocol can be launched from an AMBER topology and coordinates. This can be done using the `openmm-from-amber` subcommand.

``` {bash}
$ openduck openmm-from-amber -h

usage: openduck openmm-from-amber [-h] [-y YAML_INPUT] [-c COORDINATES] [-t TOPOLOGY] [-i INTERACTION]
                                  [-r RECEPTOR] [-n SMD_CYCLES] [-m MD_LENGTH] [-W WQB_THRESHOLD]
                                  [-v INIT_VELOCITIES] [-d INIT_DISTANCE] [-g GPU_ID]

OpenDUck OpenMM protocol starting from an AMBER topology and coordinates. Using the AMBER topology (prmtop) and
coordinates (inpcrd), identifies the main interaction and serial iterations of MD and SMD are performed until the
WQB or max_cycles threshold is reached.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -y YAML_INPUT, --yaml-input YAML_INPUT
                        Input yaml file with all the arguments for the OpenMM simulations from the

  -n SMD_CYCLES, --smd-cycles SMD_CYCLES
                        Number of MD/SMD cycles to perform.
  -m MD_LENGTH, --md-length MD_LENGTH
                        Length of MD sampling between SMD runs in ns.
  -W WQB_THRESHOLD, --wqb-threshold WQB_THRESHOLD
                        Minimum WQB threshold; if not reached after each SMD cycle, further
                        simulations will be terminated. If not set (default), all SMD cycles will
                        be run.
  -v INIT_VELOCITIES, --init-velocities INIT_VELOCITIES
                        Set initial velocities when heating.

  -g GPU_ID, --gpu-id GPU_ID
                        GPU ID; if not specified, runs on CPU only.
  --keep-all-files      Disable cleaning up intermediate files during simulations.

```

If prefered, the script can also be executed from a yaml file with the commands. A sample input.yaml file could be the following:
```{yaml}
interaction: A_ASN_140_ND2
coordinates: system_complex.inpcrd
topology: system_complex.prmtop
receptor: 4LR6_aligned_chunk_nowat.pdb
smd_cycles: 20
wqb_threshold: 6
gpu_id: 0
```

### Running OpenDUck in AMBER

Originally dynamic undocking was designed to run in AMBER; in OpenDUck we have maintained the same protocol for AMBER, replacing the parametrization and file-generation previously done by MOE with an open-source implementation. As with the original protocol, the user is free to choose their preferred queueing headers and preparation via either the commandline arguments or the input yaml file.
Preparation flags are very similar to those for OpenMM, as most of the implementation is shared.

```{bash}

Typically, dynamic undocking is employed as a post-docking filter in a virtual screening campaign. As such, multiple ligands might be generated simultaneously. A batch execution of the DUck preparation can be executed specifying the `--batch` argument and providing an SD-file with multiple ligands as input. Each ligand and the associated file structure will be generated in the `LIG_target_{n}` subfolder, where `n` is the ligand's position in the input SDF.

```{bash}
$ openduck amber-prepare -l ../brd4_ligands.sdf -r ../4LR6_aligned_chunk_nowat.pdb -i A_ASN_140_ND2 \
                         --waters-to-retain ../waters_to_retain.pdb -f gaff2 -ff amber14-all -w spce -ion 1 -s 30
                         --HMR --smd-cycles 10 -wqb-threshold 8 -q SGE --seed -1 --batch --threads 8
```

The queueing template is stored in `duck/templates/queueing_templates`. To customize a template, a new file can be added in the directory with the following format: `{queue_name}_array.q` or `{queue_name}.q` either if the expected execution is in an array or not. For a local execution, the `local` argument can be given for a plain list of commands.

The templates have the following format:
```
#!/bin/bash
#HEADER

{functions}

{commands}
```

### Analysis

After successfully running OpenDUck using either OpenMM or AMBER, the results can be compiled using the report submodule.
By default, the lowest $W_{QB}$ is used as a reporter for the robustness of the studied interaction, however, a better (and more formally appropiate) descriptor has been shown to be the $\Delta_{QB}$ obtained using the Jarzynski equality. When specified, a bootstrapping is performed to assess the convergence of the reported value.

**Important**

Due to the different formating of AMBER and OpenMM steered molecular dynamics output, the `--format` argument is needed when analyzing either output.
When analyzing a single result, the default pattern is the current directory (`.`). If you wish to analyze multiple directories, specify the wildcard pattern.

```{bash}
$ openduck report -h

usage: openduck report [-h] [-p PATTERN] [-d {min,single,avg,jarzynski,all}] [-o OUTPUT] [-of {csv,sdf,tbl}]
                       [--plot] [-s SUBSAMPLE_SIZE] [-i ITERATIONS] [-t STEP_THRESHOLD] [-f {amber,openmm}]

Generate a table report for dynamic undocking output. For a multi-ligand report, use the pattern flag with
wildcards to the directories.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PATTERN, --pattern PATTERN
                        Wildcard pattern to find folders with DUck data.
  -d {min,single,avg,jarzynski,all}, --data {min,single,avg,jarzynski,all}
                        Mode to compile the report [min | single | avg | jarzynski | all]
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Output file; default is printing report to stdout.
  -of {csv,sdf,tbl}, --output-format {csv,sdf,tbl}
                        Output format, [csv | sdf | tbl].
  --plot                Plot work or energy values to file.
  -s SUBSAMPLE_SIZE, --subsample-size SUBSAMPLE_SIZE
                        Subsample size for Jarzynski bootstrapping.
  -i ITERATIONS, --iterations ITERATIONS
                        Number of bootstrapping iterations for Jarzynski analysis.
  -t STEP_THRESHOLD, --step-threshold STEP_THRESHOLD
                        Step threshold to find the minima. Only needed with custom executions of DUck. Default =
                        2500 steps
  -f {amber,openmm}, --format {amber,openmm}
                        Engine used to generate results. Default = amber
```

#### Report example

Parsing $W_{QB}$ in a tabulated output format from an example from the benchmark dataset.
```{bash}
$ cd Iridium/1a28/ARG766_HN2
$ openduck report -p '*/'

System  WQB
SMIRNOFF/       5.6297999999999995
